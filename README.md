# Reference-Checker
Tool for citations checking (Chrome Extension) that can be used to expedite the process of getting an overview of self-citations and irrelevant references using AIPro.

1.	Download and unzip the aipro-refcheck-sidebar file
2.	Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3.	Turn on Developer mode (top-right corner).
4.	Click Load unpacked.
5.	Select the unzipped folder. (The extension will appear in your extensions list)
6.	Pin it to your toolbar. Click the pin icon to keep it visible.
7.	Right click the icon and select Open Side Panel
8.	Fill in Author(s), Abstract (word count updates live), and References.
9.	Click Open in AI Pro. Everything is copied to your clipboard and a new tab with aipro.elsevier.net opens.
10.	Paste (Ctrl+V) into the site.
 
This saves time from manually entering the prompt+information in the AIPro each time. Once one has a broad overview of the self-citations and irrelevant references, they can go through the manuscript and locate the references flagged by AIPro. It is recommended to also manually browse through the citations and try to find any irrelevant and wrongly added references.
